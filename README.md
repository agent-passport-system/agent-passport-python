# Agent Passport System: Python SDK

[![PyPI](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/agent-passport-system)](https://pypi.org/project/agent-passport-system/)

**Enforcement and accountability layer for AI agents. Bring your own identity.** Python implementation of the [Agent Passport Protocol](https://agent-passport.org), cross-language compatible with the [TypeScript SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/agent-passport-system). Signatures created in Python verify in TypeScript and the reverse. The Python port is a strict subset of the TS SDK. See the note under "What's Included" below for the current scope boundary.

## Install

```bash
pip install agent-passport-system
```

> **Current stable**: the version on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/agent-passport-system/), installed by default with `pip install agent-passport-system`. The 2.4 line added the Wave 1 accountability primitives (ActionReceipt, AuthorityBoundaryReceipt, CustodyReceipt, ContestabilityReceipt, APSBundle), Cognitive Attestation (Paper 4), and Instruction Provenance Receipts (v0.2). It also adds evidentiary type safety: a claim and evidence registry, a claim verifier, and a contestation cascade. All primitives are tested for byte-identical canonical JSON against the TypeScript SDK npm 3.1.0 fixtures.


## Quick Start

Lead with the minimum you need to get a signed passport and a verifiable delegation: identity, delegation, and policy evaluation. Import the rest from `agent_passport` when you need it. Full protocol surface (all 8 layers: attribution, values, agora, intent, coordination, commerce) is still available on the same package.

```python
from agent_passport import (
    generate_key_pair, create_passport, sign_passport, verify_passport,
    create_delegation, verify_delegation, create_action_receipt,
    # full surface available, import more when you need it:
    # build_merkle_root, load_floor, attest_floor, evaluate_compliance, ...
)

# Create agent identity (Ed25519)
keys = generate_key_pair()
passport = create_passport(
    agent_id="agent-alpha-001",
    public_key=keys["public_key"],
    capabilities=["code_execution", "web_search"]
)
signed = sign_passport(passport, keys["private_key"])
assert verify_passport(signed, keys["public_key"])

# Delegate authority
delegation = create_delegation(
    from_agent="human-001",
    to_agent="agent-alpha-001",
    scope=["code_execution"],
    private_key=keys["private_key"],
    spend_limit=500
)
assert verify_delegation(delegation, keys["public_key"])

# Record work as signed receipt
receipt = create_action_receipt(
    agent_id="agent-alpha-001",
    delegation_id=delegation["id"],
    action="code_execution",
    scope_used="code_execution",
    private_key=keys["private_key"],
    spend=50,
    result="success",
    description="Implemented feature X"
)

# Merkle proofs for attribution
hashes = [receipt["receipt_hash"]]
root = build_merkle_root(hashes)
proof = get_merkle_proof(hashes, hashes[0])
assert verify_merkle_proof(hashes[0], proof, root)
```

## What's Included

| Module | Layer | What It Does |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| `crypto` | base | Ed25519 key generation, signing, verification |
| `canonical` | base | Deterministic JSON serialization (cross-language compatible) |
| `passport` | 1 | Agent identity creation, signing, verification, expiry |
| `delegation` | 1 | Pre-draft compatibility delegation chains, sub-delegation, revocation. Deprecated, frozen, not on the draft-03 path |
| `v2.authority_delegation` | 1 | AuthorityDelegationV1, the draft-03 delegated authority record: closed schema, seven-facet narrowing, chain verification with an explicit `now` and caller-supplied key, trust and revocation resolvers, and an in-memory spend ledger |
| `values` | 2 | Human Values Floor: load YAML/JSON, attestation, compliance, graduated enforcement |
| `attribution` | 3 | Merkle proofs, beneficiary tracing, contribution tracking |
| `agora` | 4 | Signed message feeds, topics, threading, agent registry |
| `intent` | 5a | Roles, deliberation, consensus, tradeoff evaluation, precedents |
| `policy` | 5b | 3-signature chain, FloorValidatorV1, action intents |
| `coordination` | 6 | Task lifecycle: briefs, evidence, review, handoff, deliverables |
| `integration` | 7 | Cross-layer bridges (commerce+intent, coord+agora, etc.) |
| `commerce` | 8 | 4-gate checkout, human approval, spend tracking, receipts |

## Cross-Language Compatibility

The Python SDK produces identical canonical JSON and Ed25519 signatures as the TypeScript SDK. This means:

- A passport signed in Python can be verified in TypeScript
Two delegation records ship, and they are not interchangeable. `AuthorityDelegationV1` (`record_type` `aps:authority-delegation:v1`) in `v2.authority_delegation` is the delegated authority record of `draft-pidlisnyi-aps-03` section 3.1, with the seven signed facets and a chain verifier that returns valid, invalid, indeterminate or unsupported. The older `Delegation` from `create_delegation`, `sub_delegate` and `verify_delegation` is a pre-draft compatibility surface, deprecated and frozen: it predates the draft wire format and is not on the draft path. Its scope rules are pre-draft too and differ from section 3.2 in both directions, which is recorded on each function. New work uses `AuthorityDelegationV1`.

- Delegation chains can span Python and TypeScript agents
- Merkle roots computed from the same receipts match across languages

```python
from agent_passport import canonical_json

# Same input produces identical output in Python and TypeScript
data = {"z": 1, "a": 2, "nested": {"b": 3, "a": 1}}
assert canonical_json(data) == '{"a":2,"nested":{"a":1,"b":3},"z":1}'
```

## Verification boundary

[The verification boundary](https://github.com/agent-passport-system/agent-passport-python/blob/main/docs/verification-boundary.md) names the verification APIs that establish authority from caller-supplied trust, and the trust input each one takes.

## Protocol Layers

This Python SDK implements all 8 Agent Passport Protocol layers:

1. **Identity + Delegation**: Ed25519 passports, scoped delegation chains, cascade revocation
2. **Human Values Floor**: 7 principles (F-001 through F-007), graduated enforcement (inline/audit/warn)
3. **Beneficiary Attribution**: Merkle proofs for contribution tracking
4. **Agent Agora**: Signed message feeds with topics, threading, and agent registry
5. **Intent Architecture + Policy Engine**: Roles, deliberation, consensus, 3-signature policy chain
6. **Coordination**: Full task lifecycle: briefs, evidence, review, handoff, deliverables
7. **Integration Wiring**: Cross-layer bridges (commerce+intent, coordination+agora)
8. **Agentic Commerce**: 4-gate checkout, human approval, spend limits

Cross-language parity with the [TypeScript SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/agent-passport-system) at the reference version pinned in this repository's fixtures. Python SDK 3.0.0 ships the full Wave 1 surface: ActionReceipt, AuthorityBoundaryReceipt, CustodyReceipt, ContestabilityReceipt, APSBundle (with balanced Merkle commitment), Cognitive Attestation (Paper 4: three-stage verification, typed dispute primitives), and Instruction Provenance Receipts v0.2 (path canonicalization, context-root binding, action-time recompute). The four evidentiary type safety primitives also ship in 3.0.0. All surfaces are tested against TS-issued fixtures for byte-identical canonical JSON. Cross-language signature verification covers every signed primitive in the SDK. Also available via the [MCP server](https://mcp.aeoess.com/sse).

## Tests

```bash
pip install -e ".[test]"
pytest tests/
# the tally is whatever pytest reports on the current checkout
# plus the v2 evidentiary type safety, Wave 1 accountability, Cognitive Attestation,
# and Instruction Provenance Receipt surfaces. The cross-impl byte-parity tests assert
# byte-identical canonical JSON against TS-issued fixtures (rfc8785 ships in the test
# extra). Two cross-language tests also need the agent-passport-system TS SDK checked
# out next to this repo; without that sibling they skip.
